    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups shredded potato</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated onion</li>
        <li>6 saltine crackers, or as needed, crushed</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine potato, onion, crushed crackers, eggs, salt, 
            and pepper together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/4 inch oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Drop spoonfuls of potato mixture, first pressing mixture against side of the bowl to remove excess liquid, 
            into hot oil; slightly flatten latkes with the back of a spoon to make an even thickness.</li>
        <li>Cook in batches until browned and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Drain latkes on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
